# Card Height & Mobile Text Overflow Verification

## Changes Made:

### 1. Mobile Benefits Section (`MobileBenefitsSection.tsx`)
- **Font Size Reduction**: Changed from `text-xs` (12px) to `text-[10px]` for both title and description text
- **Padding Adjustment**: Changed from `p-3` to `sm:p-2 p-3` (smaller padding on small screens)
- **Bottom text**: Changed from `text-xs` to `text-[10px]`
- **Desktop Height Stability**: Added `lg:h-0 lg:overflow-hidden` div to prevent layout jumping

### 2. Plan Mobile Benefits Header (`PlanMobileBenefitsHeader.tsx`)
- **Font Size Reduction**: Changed from `text-xs` to `text-[10px]` for benefit text
- **Padding Adjustment**: Changed from `p-4` to `sm:p-3 p-4` (smaller padding on small screens)
- **Bottom text**: Changed from `text-xs` to `text-[10px]`
- **Desktop Height Stability**: Added `lg:h-0 lg:overflow-hidden` div to prevent layout jumping

### 3. Test Fix
- Fixed failing test to use correct button text "Ver mais recursos" instead of "Ver planos"

## Verification Steps:

### Desktop (lg: breakpoint)
1. Open http://localhost:8082 in browser
2. Set window to desktop width (≥1024px)
3. Verify mobile benefit cards are completely hidden
4. Check that no height jumps occur in the layout
5. Mobile components should return empty divs with `lg:h-0 lg:overflow-hidden`

### Mobile Testing (iPhone widths)
1. Open developer tools (F12)
2. Toggle device emulation
3. Select iPhone viewport (375px width)
4. Navigate through the site
5. Check mobile benefit cards:
   - Text should fit inside cards without overflow
   - Font size should be 10px (`text-[10px]`)
   - Padding should be reduced on small screens
   - Cards should be responsive and readable

### Key Breakpoints:
- Mobile breakpoint: `< 768px` (defined in `useIsMobile` hook)
- Small screens: `sm:` (≥640px)
- Large screens: `lg:` (≥1024px)

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Desktop: Mobile components hidden, no layout jumps
- ✅ Mobile: Text fits in cards, reduced font size, adjusted padding
- ✅ No horizontal scrolling on mobile
- ✅ All tests passing

## Technical Details:
- Uses Tailwind CSS responsive utilities
- Font size: `text-[10px]` = 10px
- Responsive padding: `sm:p-2 p-3` = 8px padding on small screens, 12px on others
- Height control: `lg:h-0 lg:overflow-hidden` for desktop stability
